# 🚛 Real-Time Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Tracker
A real-time web application built during a hackathon to track, analyze, and visualize carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generated by logistics and transportation routes.
The platform combines live map-based distance calculation with instant emission analytics to help businesses monitor their environmental impact and make more sustainable supply chain decisions.

# 🌍 Project Overview
Supply chains generate a large portion of global carbon emissions, yet most companies lack real-time visibility into their environmental impact.
This project solves that by providing:
✔ Instant carbon emission calculation per trip
✔ Interactive route mapping
✔ Live dashboards & charts
✔ Emission history tracking
✔ Optimization suggestions for lower emissions

# ⚡ Features
Secure user authentication
Homepage & analytics dashboard
Trip and record management
Real-time CO₂ calculation engine
