# 🚛 Real-Time Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Tracker<br>

A real-time web application built during a hackathon to track, analyze, and visualize carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generated by logistics and transportation routes.<br>
The platform combines live map-based distance calculation with instant emission analytics to help businesses monitor their environmental impact and make more sustainable supply chain decisions.<br><br>
